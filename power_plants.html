											<i>note: As you know Tableau sheets and dashboards are dynamic and interactive, so I highly recomennd visiting the link to see the original work,
												but if for some reason you choose not too, I download static images of them for this website.

									<h4>Preparation</h4>
									<p>Originally I planned to do some work in SQL, but I realized that the data didn't really require cleaning, it came in a good shape. I wanted to download
										the result of some queries that I prepared in SQL for visualizing the data, but I also came to a conclusion that it is more flexible and I can show more (e.g. filters)
										if I just add the file directly to Tableau. The only thing I prepared in SQL is adding a SERIAL id column to the table.
										The dataset is a csv file with 15 fields and about 35 000 records. It holds geographical and identification data of power plants all over the world, and it also
										contains data about the year they started working, their capacity and fuel. 
										I also added the World Bank population data of 2021 as another table. I joined the two tables ON country_codes.<br><br>

											<h3>Leading powers in producing electricty</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>First let's focus on who have the most of power plants?<br>
												Here is the viz of our query result:
												<div class="inner">
													<figure><image src="images/top10_number.png" width=80%></image></figure>
												</div>
											<li>But having the most doesn't necessarily means producing the most energity, so probably it more useful the focus on the actually generated power.
												Unfortunately the data is far from complete. We have a column for the generated GWhs in 2021 and we have an estimation column for the same.
												But if we query how many records show NULL is both columns, then we see that even in the leading countries of our search we are missing thousands of
												data points. So, we should use our next best option, the capacity.
												<br><i>note: Capacity also won't give us a perfect picture, because it does NOT guarantee that all the power plants are working full time, but it is our
													closest estimate.</i>
												<br>Let'see the the top 10 countries by total capacity.
												
												<figure><image src="images/top10_capacity.png" width=80%></image></figure>
												
												I chose to make a bar chart for these first two visualizations, using the same color codes for the same countries, so it is easier for the eye to compare
												their positions.<br>
												We see that the list is somewhat similar, but some players and orders have changed. For example China has less than half as many power plants as the US,
												but its capacity surpasses the other's. So i was a valid call to use capacity instead of just the mere count of the plants.<br> 
											<li>When we talk about a country's production, we cannot ignore the size of the country, what to some degree is reflected in how big the population is. 
												By JOINing the power plants and the population tables ON the country code, we can look at the capacity calculated for every 100 000 inhabitants.
												
													<figure><image src="images/per_capita.png" width=100%></image></figure>
												Here you can see that the picture is pretty different now. The earlier top countries here are marked by blue, and they are not necessarily all leading anymore.
										
											</li>
											<li>In the previous vizzes we can compare countries' total production and their production by the sam kind of fuel, but it would be nice to see a comparison of the magnitude
												of different players' output divided by the fuel. This gave me the perfect opportunity to use the stacked bubbles.
												
													<figure><image src="images/biggest_producers.png" width=50%></image></figure>
											</li>
											<li>If we want to dive into more the details about each country, then on this interactive map you can just choose a country and with the help of the primary fuel filter,
												get the data of the specific production.
												
													<figure><image src="images/country_details.png" width=60%></image></figure>
											</li>
											<li>Using the geographical data (latitude and longitude), I compared the production of the Northern and Southern hemisphere as well.
												I added a column in SQL to the table, where I labeled the records with 'Northern' and 'Southern' labels and used that data for the comparison.
												
													<figure><image src="images/hemispheres.png" width=60%></image></figure>
											</li>
											<li>One more interesting visualization can be done from the data. We can show a timeline and display how many power plants the leading countries have at that point
												in time using a Running Total.
												
													<figure><image src="images/cumulative_numbers.png" width=60%></image></figure>
											</li>
										</ul>
										</p>
											
											<li><i>note: All the sheets can be filtered for primary fuel.</i><br>
